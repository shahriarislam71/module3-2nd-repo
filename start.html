    <h1>In this module I have learnt about github reposetories</h1>
    <p>If I wants to save my code somewhere then github reposetory could be the best option. Now question is how to keep the code into github repository? First of all, I need to open a new github repository by clicking the '+' icon. Then I need to set the name of the reposetory and The best practice is to remain the same repository name that we use  in our local folder. Then click on the create repository button and a new repository is oped as soon as clicked on the buttons.Now, we will push our code.To push the we need to follow some steps. First of all, I will open the command prompt/terminal,git bash etc to push the code and we need to connect this side with our local folder.After connecting with local folder ,I will initialize the files with 'git init'. secondly, I need to add the files with 'git add .' comand.After git add , if we put a comma that means we will add all the files here.Afterthat, we need to commit those files with 'git commit -m  " "'comand.If we use the github for the first time, then we will face some problems that is we might need to give our name and email address.Then, we need to give the comand of 'git branch -M' and then we need to select where to move our files and finally we will write git push. Then we will able to see our files on our github repositories.After sending the codes on our repositories , we thought that we need to add something on the code. To resend the code  first of all we need to add the files with 'git add'command.then we nedd to comit it and finally we will push the code. </p>
    <h3>Now if we wants to share our website to others then what should we do?</h3>
    <p>First of all, click on our desired website link and then go to the settings option and will find the option pages.By clicking on the pages option, then we will see a option named 'none'.Then we convert the none option into 'main' option and save the changes.Then we will able to see the live server link of our website.</p>
    <h1>Some common problems....</h1>
    <h3>for some cases we will see that our live server wont work.writing wrong file name is the one reason for this.when we code on vs code then the best practice is to give the file name is'index.html'.If we write others file name and open our live server then it will show error.Then we need to bring some changes into our live links.We simply write file name after the link.Then it will work. </h3>
    <h3>If I open a new repository and then if i will delete the repository for some problems and then again i will open a new repository for the same local drive folder and try to push the code then it will give me the erros in 5th position of commit.Then what should I do? Then i simply remember everything and open a new local forder and a new repository for this folder and then push the the code as earlier.</h3>
